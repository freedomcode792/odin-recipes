<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place bread on a rimmed baking sheet. </p></li>
    <li><p>Whisk together oil, butter, garlic, salt, and pepper in a liquid measure. Pour mixture over the bread and toss with your hands until evenly coated. Spread bread mixture into a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and toasted, yet slightly soft in the center, 15 to 18 minutes, tossing croutons a few times during baking. Remove from the oven and let cool completely while you prepare the salad. </p></li>
    <li><p>Place garlic, anchovies, and salt in a large salad serving bowl; press the mixture with a fork until a paste forms. Stir in egg yolk, lemon juice, Dijon, and Worcestershire sauce until well combined. Slowly whisk in olive oil until all is incorporated and mixture is well blended and smooth. Stir in 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Remove about 1/4 cup of dressing and set aside for another use. </p></li>
    <li><p>When ready to serve, add lettuce and 1/2 of the croutons to the bowl with the remaining dressing; toss until well coated. Reserve remaining croutons for another use. </p></li>
    <li><p>Sprinkle salad with additional Parmesan and pepper if desired. Serve immediately. </p></li>
